        <h2>A Vacation Plan</h2>
        <P>During normal days we do not get much time to socialize with our friends 
            and relatives. Thus, we can use the vacation to meet our friends and relatives 
            and socialize. Also, you can plan a trip with your family or friends from your 
            everyday life. Always try to go for one trip during the summer or winter holidays.</P>
